# Error Troubleshooting

## Error Message - Source has nothing to capture

### Symptom

For Linux client, if they called ErrorCode or ErrorString after scanning, it might show the error "Source has nothing to capture".

### Workaround

Though the error message shows "source has nothing to capture", but the scanning process has finished successfully. Please note, the error message will not affect the process, you can continue to use scanning feature. It's a known issue and currently there is no solution for that.

### Planning

The issue will be fixed in the V18.
